# consec_cluster

An R Shiny app (`app.R`) for processing actigraphy (activity) data (.csv input). The app allows for conditional threshold setting for clustering up to 10 observations over time.

The output is a plot to guide manual threshold setting and downloadable tabular data (.csv output)

The file `ex_data.rdata` contains default data to run or troubleshoot the app in lieu of actigraphy data.
